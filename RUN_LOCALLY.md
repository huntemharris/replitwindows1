# Running Utah Valley Window Cleaners Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine.

## 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Version 20.x or higher
- **PostgreSQL**: A local instance or a hosted database (like Neon, Supabase, or AWS RDS)
- **npm**: (Comes with Node.js)

## 2. Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

```env
# Database connection string
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/window_cleaner_db

# Secret for session management
SESSION_SECRET=your_random_secret_string_here

# Email configuration (Gmail example)
# Note: For Gmail, use an "App Password" not your regular password
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

## 3. Installation
Open your terminal in the project directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

## 4. Database Initialization
Push the schema to your PostgreSQL database:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

## 5. Start the Application

### Development Mode
Runs the server with live reloading and Vite development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
The app will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Production Mode
Builds the frontend and runs the optimized production server:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## 6. Project Structure
- `client/`: React frontend (Vite, Tailwind, Shadcn UI)
- `server/`: Express backend and database storage logic
- `shared/`: Shared TypeScript types and Drizzle schema
- `migrations/`: Database migration files (generated by Drizzle)

## 7. Portability
This app is designed to be portable. When moving to GitHub or a production server:
1. Ensure `.env` is **not** committed to version control.
2. Set the environment variables in your hosting provider's dashboard.
3. The app will automatically use the `PORT` environment variable (defaults to 5000).
